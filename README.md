# Reddit Conversation Data Analytics & Visualization with Matplotlib

Simple tools to visualize data from Reddit such as the relationship between posting time to upvote, comment sorting to upvote and replies, and word cloud. Utilizing Colaboratory to present the visualization in a tidy manner, and easily integrated for further usage.

A complete explanation can be found in the notebook. Meanwhile, a detailed explanation is provided in the [LearningDollars blog](https://blog.learningdollars.com/?p=2949).

## Setup

Please go through the [previous project](https://github.com/learningdollars/reddit-twitter-convo-data) to get the Reddit data, or you can use a [sample data here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n0HGPUp23JRFNSRn7YmYmDW34on9DI7N/view). Add it to your Google Drive account, and place it in the main directory (you may place it elsewhere, but you have to modify some stuff in the file-loading program).

No special setup needed as the whole process done in Colaboratory. For local usage, you may clone the repository & run it as if you run any other Python Notebook.

## Options

You can modify almost every aspect of the graph, and the data to be visualized.
